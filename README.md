#Fianal GA Project- CS: Helpdesk

#Imagine a world with one place you can store and organise those links?

#My project uses, HTML, Bootstrap and Ruby on Rails.

I also used:

The command line
Source control - git hub
Researched using various tutorials, websites, books and links
Comments in code
Deployment to Heroku
Trello

#What issues did I experience and what I did not get working?

Had a trouble understanding Associations and linking the models together
Had trouble with the devise and rails admin gem due to their limitations to personalise.
Understanding how Ruby works, however I have learnt a great deal from this project

#What I would like to add?

Social media icons
Clean, condensed code
More styling and features
Implement the chat room
Image / file upload

#What I would do next time?

Take a bit more time in understanding what I want the app to do and achieve
Spend more time to understand the navigation and what I need to do to connect the models together
Git hub more often (everytime something works)
